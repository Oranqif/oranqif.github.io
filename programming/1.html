                <h3>About the project</h3>
                <p>
                    When I was tasked by my lecturer to create a rudimentary online store, my thought leaned toward video games because I love playing video games. 
                    So I wanted to create an online store focused on selling gaming products.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started by creating a Home page with a navigation bar that can navigate to six pages.
                    The pages are laid out like this in order...
                    <ul style="list-style: square;">
                        <li>Home</li>
                        <li>Video Games</li>
                        <li>Consoles & Controllers</li>
                        <li>Figures</li>
                        <li>Cart</li>
                        <li>Contact</li>
                    </ul>
                    The image below was the end result of my implementation...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>My implementation for the Home page</h4>
                            <img style="height:347.5px; width:633.75px" src="../public/programming_ejs1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a home page" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, to render the page, creating the route to the home page is necessary.
                    Without it, the application would not render the page because there was no route for it thus did not know that the page existed.
                    Also, I would have had to implement routing for every new EJS pages created.
                    The image below was what had happened if there was no routing for the page...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>This is the result of no routing for the page</h4>
                            <img style="height:347.5px; width:633.75px" src="../public/programming_ejs2.jpg" alt="Display an error telling you that it does not exists" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then, for the Video Game page, it needed to display an item and it has to be inside a card for readability.
                    Not only that, the page needed to display multiple cards too without the card constricting onto themselves.
                    To accomplish this, I created the page first that display the item by getting their ID then use CSS flexbox to create the card and a container that dynamically move the cards around depending on how many cards there are.
                    The images below showed the Video Game page displaying items inside their respective card dynamically...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>My implementation for Video Game page</h4>
                            <img style="height:347.5px; width:633.75px" src="../public/programming_ejs3.jpg" alt="Screenshot of items displayed" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>See how it had displayed the items dynamically?</h4>
                            <img style="height:347.5px; width:633.75px" src="../public/programming_ejs4.jpg" alt="Screenshot of seeing items displayed dynamically" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, it is time to create a page to create, edit, and delete items for the Video Game page with the RESTful api.
                    REST is a type of software architectural style that emphasises uniform interfaces, independent employement of components and the scalability of interactions between them.
                    In this case, it was focused on scalability as each of the items need their own page to edit.
                    I did this by, after creating the ability to add and delete item, implementing a route that allowed one page to edit a chosen item through reading their ID.
                    Repeat this process for the Consoles & Controllers and the Figurines pages.
                    The image below is the page for adding, editing and deleting item...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>The page that can add, edit, and delete item</h4>
                            <img style="height:347.5px; width:633.75px" src="../public/programming_ejs5.jpg" alt="A page where there is a table of items" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, the data for the items have to had come from somewhere.
                    This is where Structured Query Language (SQL) came into place.
                    SQL allows for persistent storage even if the website was reloaded as it was stored outside of it.
                    The images below showed what the database looked like and how it was stored...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>The database</h4>
                            <img style="height:347.5px; width:633.75px" src="../public/programming_ejs6.jpg" alt="A screenshot of phpmyadmin" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>How items were stored in games for the Video Game page</h4>
                            <img style="height:347.5px; width:633.75px" src="../public/programming_ejs7.jpg" alt="A screenshot of how data is stored" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Final Version</h3>
                <div class="container-content-body-video">
                    <video height="10%" width="100%" controls>
                        <source src="../public/programming_ejs8.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support video tag
                    </video>
                </div>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    This was my first dive into utilizing a framework for JavaScript.
                    After this project, I can see how frameworks could speed up the development of the project by making it easier to implement certain features that could be hard to do so in vanilla JavaScript.
                    I had learnt a tons from this experience and I am willing to further expand my knowledge of Embedded JavaScript (EJS) if possible.
