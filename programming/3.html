                <p>
                    Have you had trouble trying to remember what tasks you were supposed to do?
                    Have you ever mixed up a task with another?
                    Have you wished to simply categorize your tasks?
                    Say no more as this app can track all three categories of tasks to complete in your day-to-day basis.
                </p>
                <h3>About the project</h3>
                <p>
                    This app idea came to me when I thought of how I wanted to categorize my tasks so that I do not lose easily mix up or lose track of them.
                    I got my start by first creating a main page that could access to each category...
                    <ul style="list-style: square;">
                        <li>General</li>
                        <li>Grocery</li>
                        <li>Fitness</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each of the categories are styled with different colours to further differentiate them from one another.
                    The image below is the result...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>The home screen of the app</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app1.jpg" alt="Image of a home screen"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then, I began creating from the first category 'General'.
                    The 'General' category would have tasks that were too broad to be categorized such as 'Go to the library and read something' or 'Do your chores'.
                    The user could add, edit, delete tasks and a checkbox that communicate to the user which ones have had already been done.
                    Furthermore, there was a button that told you how many tasks you have left undone.
                    The images below showed what the 'General' page looked like...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>Tasks are displayed here</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app2.jpg" alt="Image of tasks displayed on this page"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Add a task</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app3.jpg" alt="Image of a form that add a task"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Edit or check off a task</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app4.jpg" alt="Image of a form that edit task details"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Check your progress</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app9.jpg" alt="Image of a screen telling you your progress"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, the 'Grocery' category.
                    The 'Grocery' category would have grocery tasks shopping which involved finances.
                    The user could use it to check how much they spent on each item without thinking as the app had already calculated it for you.
                    As for the button, it could calculate the total cost of every item added together.
                    The images below showed what the 'Grocery' page looked like...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>Groceries are displayed here</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app5.jpg" alt="Image of a groceries displayed on this page"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Add a grocery</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app6.jpg" alt="Image of a form that add a grocery"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Edit or check off a grocery</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app7.jpg" alt="Image of a form that edit grocery details"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Check your total cost</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app8.jpg" alt="Image of a screen telling you how much they cost together"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, the 'Fitness' category.
                    The 'Fitness' category would have fitness tasks which involved exercising.
                    The user could use it to track how many exercises they did and how many reps they would had to do.
                    The button works similarly to 'General' as it would show your progress towards completing all the exercises.
                    The images below showed what the 'Fitness' page looked like...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>Exercises are displayed here</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app10.jpg" alt="Image of exercises displayed on a screen"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Add an exercise</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app11.jpg" alt="Image of a form that add an exercise"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Edit or check off an exercise</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app12.jpg" alt="Image of a form that edit exercise details"/>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>Check your progress</h4>
                            <img style="height:512px;" src="../public/programming_app13.jpg" alt="Image of a screen telling you your progress"/>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Demostration</h3>
                <div class="container-content-body-video">
                    <video height="10%" width="100%" controls>
                        <source src="../public/programming_app14.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support video tag
                    </video>
                </div>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I learnt how to develop a proper albeit rudimentary mobile application using WebStorm and Android Studio.
                    Additionally, I also learnt how to apply style and made it looked more aesthetically pleasing and increased readability for the user.
                    If I were to do this again, I would come up with a more complex mobile application that would greatly benefit the user that needed it.
