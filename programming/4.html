                    A virtual reality game where the player woke up inside a building confused about their surrounding.
                    They found out that they are trapped inside a tower thanks to a bored wizard that wanted to play a
                    game with them.
                    The instruction was simple, find all the clues then solve all three puzzles inside the wizard tower
                    to earn their freedom.
                </p>
                <h3>About the project</h3>
                <p>
                    I was assigned by my lecturer to create a virtual reality game that involved solving puzzles.
                    When thinking up of a theme to base the game around with, what came to mind was this...
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>The genre will be an escape room situated in a cartoon fantasy world.</li>
                        <li>The narrative will have the player awaken inside the wizard tower where he will have to find clues and solve various puzzles to get out.</li>
                        <li>Inspired by the fantastical setting this game will take place in.</li>
                    </ul>
                    ...The idea of utilizing magical devices to aid in your escape was too great for me to pass up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Why I had decided to go with the idea was because it would allow me to not be restricted by
                    realism, give more space for suspension of disbelief from the player playing this game, and more importantly the opportunity to create a more fun puzzle for better gameplay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, the artstyle for this game was a cartoony look to it with a touch of realism to make the artstyle pop out more.
                    The images below show what these objects looked like from the concept art and the inside of the game...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>My concept art for what the assets would look like</h4>
                            <img style="height:384px; width:384px;" src="../public/programming_unity8.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>A sword</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity5.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>A crystal</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity3.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>A chest</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity6.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>A table and a key</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity4.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then, I wanted my spawn point to have elements around the player like a bookshelf, a lever to indicate there was puzzle, and a door for the player to work towards.
                    However, the finalized spawn point in the game was different from the concept art because I moved the other elements like the door below the spawn point and the chest above it for the player to discover.
                    The images below show how the concept art for the spawn point looked like, and the finalized version of it...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>My concept art for the starting area</h4>
                            <img style="width:768px;" src="../public/programming_unity9.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The finalized version front</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity10.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The finalized version right</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity11.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The finalized version left</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity13.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The finalized version back</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity12.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, for the puzzles.
                    The puzzles I ended up creating were...
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>Finding all three of the apples to put into a cauldron to obtain the crystal for the combination crystal puzzle.</li>
                        <li>Finding all three pieces of a key and to bring them back to a table to reconstruct it for the chest.</li>
                        <li>Solving the combination crystal puzzle using clue from a note to finally escape the tower.</li>
                    </ul>
                    ...Despite them not looking like how I had imagined them inside my head, the puzzles were somewhat magical in nature and served the gameplay well enough for the player to engage in.
                    The images below show what these puzzles looked like inside the game...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="container-content-body-image">
                        <div>
                            <h4>An apple</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity16.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>A cauldron</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity15.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>A broken piece of a key</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity14.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>A table used for reconstructing a key</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity4.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The crystal combination puzzle</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity2.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h4>The door to freedom</h4>
                            <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" src="../public/programming_unity17.jpg" alt="Concept Art for the game" />
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, the tower the game is taking place in or more specifically 'Wizard Tower' because of how it looked and who inhabited it.
                    The tower had five floors for the player to explore around and find notes for clues to solving the puzzles.
                    I chose five because it seemed to be the right amount for me to distribute the content around the building.
                    The images below show the concept art of the layout of the tower and how it looked in the finalized version...
                    <br>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    This was my first ever game, let alone a virtual reality one, that was created using the game engine Unity.
                    I had thoroughly enjoyed myself creating this game because of the full creative control over the project excluding the genre of game.
